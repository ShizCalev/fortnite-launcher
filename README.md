# Fortnite Steam Overlay Launcher
 
Add it as a non-steam game and it will handle launching Epic & Fortnite for you!

If your Epic isn't installed at the default location, add the full path to EpicGamesLauncher.exe as a launch parameter. ie; "C:/PROGRA~2/Epic Games/Launcher/Portal/Binaries/Win32/EpicGamesLauncher.exe"
